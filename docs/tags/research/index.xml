      <description>Title: Upper Limit on the Coronal Cosmic Ray Energy Budget in Seyfert Galaxies.
Authors: Yoshiyuki Inoue, Shinsuke Takasao, Dmitry Khangulyan
The IceCube collaboration has reported possible detections of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies. While central hot coronae are proposed as the primary neutrino production site, the exact coronal cosmic-ray energy budget has been loosely constrained. In this study, we propose a new stringent upper bound on the coronal cosmic-ray energy budget of Seyfert galaxies, considering both accretion dynamics and observed properties of radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies.</description>

      <description>Title: Energetic Particles and High-Energy Processes in Cosmological Filaments and Their Astronomical Implications.
Authors: Kinwah Wu, Ellis R. Owen, Qin Han, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Lilian Luo
Large-scale cosmic filaments connect galaxies, clusters and voids. They are permeated by magnetic fields with a variety of topologies. Cosmic rays with energies up to 1020eV can be produced in astrophysical environments associated with star-formation and AGN activities. The fate of these cosmic rays in filaments, which cannot be directly observed on Earth, are rarely studied.</description>

      <description>Title: Multi-epoch X-ray spectral analysis of Centaurus A: revealing new constraints on iron emission line origins .
Authors: Toshiya Iwata, Atsushi Tanimoto, Hirokazu Odaka, Aya Bamba, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Kouichi Hagino We conduct X-ray reverberation mapping and spectral analysis of the radio galaxy Centaurus A to uncover its central structure. We compare the light curve of the hard X-ray continuum from Swift Burst Alert Telescope observations with that of the Fe Kα fluorescence line, derived from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), Suzaku, XMM-Newton, and Swift X-ray Telescope observations.</description>

      <description>Title: Deciphering Radio Emissions from Accretion Disk Winds in Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei.
Authors: Tomoya Yamada, Nobuyuki Sakai, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Tomonari Michiyama
Unraveling the origins of radio emissions from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGNs) remains a pivotal challenge in astrophysics. One potential source of this radiation is the shock interaction between AGN disk winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). To understand this phenomenon, we construct a spherical, one-zone, and self-similar expansion model of shock structure between ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and the ISM.</description>

      <description>Title: ALMA Confirmation of Millimeter Time Variability in the Gamma-Ray Detected Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734-292.
Authors: Tomonari Michiyama, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Akihiro Doi, Tomoya Yamada, Yasushi Fukazawa, Hidetoshi Kubo, Samuel Barnier
GRS 1734-292 is a radio-quiet galaxy, exhibiting neither intense starburst nor jet activities. However, Fermi-LAT detected this object in the GeV band. The origin of non-thermal activity in this Seyfert galaxy is an intriguing question. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.</description>

      <description>Title: Gamma-ray emission in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151: Investigating the role of jet and coronal activities.
Authors: Yoshiyuki Inoue, Dmitry Khangulyan
NGC 4151, a nearby Seyfert galaxy, has recently been reported to emit gamma rays in the GeV range, posing an intriguing astrophysical mystery. The star formation rate of NGC 4151 is too low to explain the observed GeV flux, but the galaxy is known for its coronal activity in X-ray and jet activity in radio.</description>

Authors: Ellis R. Owen, Kinwah Wu, Yoshiyuki Inoue, H.-Y. Karen Yang, Alison M. W. Mitchell
Galaxy evolution is an important topic, and our physical understanding must be complete to establish a correct picture. This includes a thorough treatment of feedback. The effects of thermal-mechanical and radiative feedback have been widely considered, however cosmic rays (CRs) are also powerful energy carriers in galactic ecosystems.</description>

      <description>Title: The centimeter-to-submillimeter broad-band radio spectrum of the central compact component in a nearby type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068.
Authors: Tomonari Michiyama, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Akihiro Doi
We analyze all the available Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array archival data of the nearby Type-II Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, including new 100 GHz data with the angular resolution of 0\farcs05, which was not included in previous continuum spectral analysis. By combining with the literature data based on the Very Large Array, we investigate the broadband radio continuum spectrum of the central ≲7 pc region of NGC 1068.</description>

      <description>Title: On the Zeeman Effect in Magnetically-Arrested Disks.
Authors: Yoshiyuki Inoue
Magnetically arrested disk (MAD) has been argued as the key accretion phase to realize the formation of relativistic jets. However, due to the lack of magnetic field measurements of accreting systems, MAD has not been observationally confirmed yet. Here we propose that a strong magnetic field accompanied by MAD would induce the Zeeman splitting of relativistically broadened Fe Kα fluorescence lines in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, where we consider a two-phase medium in the inner accretion disk, magnetically dominated hot corona and cold reflector.</description>

      <description>Title: MeV Gamma-Ray Source Contribution to the Inner Galactic Diffuse Emission .
Authors: Naomi Tsuji, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Hiroki Yoneda, Reshmi Mukherjee, Hirokazu Odaka
The origin of the inner Galactic emission, measured by COMPTEL with a flux of ∼10−2 MeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1 in the 1-30 MeV energy range from the inner Galactic region, has remained unsettled since its discovery. In this paper, we elaborate on a model of individual MeV gamma-ray sources unresolved by COMPTEL.</description>

      <description>Title: High energy emission component, population, and contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background of gamma-ray emitting radio galaxies.
Authors: Yasushi Fukazawa, Hiroto Matake, Taishu Kayanoki, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Justin Finke
In this study, we systematically studied the X-ray to GeV gamma-ray spectra of 61 {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) detected radio galaxies. We found an anticorrelation between peak frequency and peak luminosity in the high-energy spectral component of radio galaxies, similar to blazars.</description>

      <description>Title: A fundamental plane in X-ray binary activity of external galaxies.
Authors: Yoshiyuki Inoue, Kiyoto Yabe, Yoshihiro Ueda
We construct a new catalog of extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) by matching the latest Chandra source catalog with local galaxy catalogs. Our XRB catalog contains 4430 XRBs hosted by 237 galaxies within $\sim130$ Mpc. As XRBs dominate the X-ray activity in galaxies, the catalog enables us to study the correlations between the total X-ray luminosity of a galaxy, star formation rate, and stellar mass.</description>

      <description>Title: Spatial variations of magnetic field along active galactic nuclei jets on sub-pc to Mpc scales.
Authors: Soichiro Ito, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Jun Kataoka
We report the systematic analysis of knots, hotspots, and lobes in 57 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to investigate the variation of the magnetic field along with the jet from the sub-pc base to the terminus in kpc-to-Mpc scales. Expanding the number of radio/X-ray samples in \citet{2005ApJ&amp;hellip;622..797K}, we analyzed the data in 12 FR~I and 30 FR~II radio galaxies, 12 quasars, and 3 BL Lacs that contained 76 knots, 42 hotspots, and 29 radio lobes.</description>

Authors: Naomi Tsuji, Hiroki Yoneda, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Tsuguo Aramaki, Georgia Karagiorgi, Reshmi Mukherjee, Hirokazu Odaka
We report the results of a cross-match study between the hard X-ray and GeV gamma-ray catalogs, by making use of the latest 105-month Swift-BAT and 10-yr Fermi-LAT catalogs, respectively. The spatial cross-matching between the two catalogs results in the matching of 132 point-like sources, including ~5% of false-match sources.</description>

      <description>Title: Gamma-ray and Neutrino Signals from Accretion Disk Coronae of Active Galactic Nuclei.
Authors: Yoshiyuki Inoue, Dmitry Khangulyan, Akihiro Doi
To explain X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN), non-thermal activity in AGN coronae such as pair cascade models has been extensively discussed in the past literature. Although X-ray and gamma-ray observations in the 1990s disfavored such pair cascade models, recent millimeter-wave observations of nearby Seyferts establish the existence of weak non-thermal coronal activity.</description>

Authors: Philip Lu, Volodymyr Takhistov, Graciela B. Gelmini, Kohei Hayashi, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Alexander Kusenko
Black holes formed in the early universe, prior to the formation of stars, can exist as dark matter and also contribute to the black hole merger events observed in gravitational waves. We set a new limit on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) by considering interactions of PBHs with the interstellar medium, which result in the heating of gas.</description>

Authors: Jun Kataoka, Marino Yamamoto, Yuki Nakamura, Soichiro Ito, Yoshiaki Sofue, Yoshiyuki Inoue, Takeshi Nakamori, Tomonori Totani
In this study, we analyze giant Galactic spurs seen in both radio and X-ray all-sky maps to reveal their origins. We discuss two types of giant spurs: one is the brightest diffuse emission near the map&amp;rsquo;s center, which is likely to be related to Fermi bubbles (NPSs/SPSs, north/south polar spurs, respectively), and the other is weaker spurs that coincide positionally with local spiral arms in our Galaxy (LAS, local arm spur).</description>

      <description>Title: Cosmological Evolution of FSRQs based on the Swift/BAT 105-month Catalog and Their Contribution to the Cosmic MeV Gamma-ray Background Radiation.
Authors: Koyo Toda, Yasushi Fukazawa, Yoshiyuki Inoue
We present a new X-ray luminosity function of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) utilizing the latest Swift/BAT 105-month X-ray source catalog. Contrary to previous studies of FSRQs in the X-ray band, using the luminosity-dependent density evolution model, we find that FSRQs show evolutionary peaks at z∼1−2 depending on luminosities.</description>
