The origin of the inner Galactic emission, measured by COMPTEL with a flux of ∼10−2 MeV cm−2 s−1 sr−1 in the 1-30 MeV energy range from the inner Galactic region, has remained unsettled since its discovery. In this paper, we elaborate on a model of individual MeV gamma-ray sources unresolved by COMPTEL. This is conducted for sources crossmatched between the Swift-BAT and Fermi-LAT catalogs by interpolating the energy spectra in the hard X-ray and GeV gamma-ray ranges, as well as unmatched sources between the two catalogs. We find that the source contribution to the COMPTEL emission would be at least ~20%. Combined with the Galactic diffuse emission, which is not well constrained, the COMPTEL emission can be roughly reproduced in some cases.
