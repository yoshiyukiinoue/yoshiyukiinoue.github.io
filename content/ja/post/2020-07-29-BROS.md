Title: [Blazar Radio and Optical Survey (BROS): A catalog of blazar candidates showing flat radio spectrum and their optical identification in Pan-STARRS1 Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00038).

Utilizing the latest and the most sensitive radio and optical catalogs, we completed a new blazar candidate catalog, Blazar Radio and Optical Survey (BROS), which includes 88,211 sources located at declination $\delta>−40^\circ$ and outside the galactic plane ($|b|>10^\circ$). We list compact flat-spectrum radio sources of $\aloha>−0.6$ from 0.15 GHz TGSS and 1.4 GHz NVSS catalogs. We further identify optical counterparts of the selected sources by cross-matching with Pan-STARRS1 photometric data.   

The catalog is available from [this link](http://www.bao.city.ibara.okayama.jp/BROS/index.html).
