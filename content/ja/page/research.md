### Research Style
Our team tackles cosmic mysteries by bridging theoretical and observational approaches. We value intellectual curiosity and encourage free thinking, unrestricted by conventional methodological boundaries.


### Research Areas

#### Black Hole Physics  

Black holes remain at the forefront of modern astrophysics. Our research spans multiple scales and phenomena related to these enigmatic objects. We study primordial black holes, investigating their roles as dark matter. 

In the realm of supermassive black holes, we focus on understanding their cosmological evolution. Our work extends to the physics of active galactic nuclei, where we investigate the complex interplay between black holes and their surrounding environment.

We are particularly interested in accretion disks and jets, studying accretion flows, wind, jet, and the various processes responsible for high-energy radiation. This research helps us understand how black holes interact with and influence their surroundings.


#### Pioneering MeV Gamma-ray Astronomy

We are actively developing the [GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey)](https://express.northeastern.edu/grams/) project to explore the uncharted territory of MeV gamma-ray astronomy. This innovative project aims to observe gamma-ray bursts in unprecedented detail and enhance our understanding of radiation mechanisms from active galactic nuclei. Through GRAMS, we study cosmic ray acceleration processes and conduct dark matter indirect detection searches.

Our work involves developing cutting-edge detector systems and advanced data analysis methods. These technical developments not only serve our current research goals but also pave the way for future missions in high-energy astrophysics.
