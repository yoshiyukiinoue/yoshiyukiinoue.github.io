We are pleasure to hear that two excellent undergraduate students in our group defended their bachelor thesis presentations. Katsunori Kusakabe looked into the stellar magnetic field condition to realize the magnetically arrested disk in X-ray binaries. Tatsuki Fujiwara worked on 26Al gamma-ray line signals from solar bodies as well as the estimation of past cosmic-ray activity using comets. Congratulations to all of them!
