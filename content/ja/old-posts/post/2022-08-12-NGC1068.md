Title: [ALMA Detection of Parsec-scale Blobs at the Head of a Kiloparsec-scale Jet in the Nearby Seyfert Galaxy NGC 1068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08533).

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations at ≈100 GHz with 0.05 arcsec (3 pc) resolution of the kiloparsec-scale jet seen in the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, and we report the presence of parsec-scale blobs at the head of the jet. The combination of the detected radio flux (≈0.8 mJy), spectral index (≈0.5), and the blob size (≈10 pc) suggests a strong magnetic field of B≈240μG. Such a strong magnetic field most likely implies magnetic field amplification by streaming cosmic rays. The estimated cosmic-ray power by the jet may exceed the limit set by the star formation activity in this galaxy. This result suggests that even modest-power jets can increase the galactic cosmic-ray content while propagating through the galactic bulge.
